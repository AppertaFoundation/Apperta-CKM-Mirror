Living will may also be known as advance directive, advance decision, advance decision to refuse treatment, personal directive, advance healthcare directive, or medical directive. 

An individual with capacity may create a living will document to record their wishes for medical care and treatment in advance, which is intended to guide decision-making in future situations in which the individual is unable to make or communicate decisions. In some countries, a living will is a legally-binding document, while, in others, it may be legally persuasive without having an official legal status.

A living will is commonly used to refuse life-sustaining treatment which may include, but is not limited to, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), clinically assisted nutrition and hydration, artificial or mechanical ventilation, and antibiotics for life-threatening infections. 

This archetype has been specifically designed to hold a nested living will details CLUSTER archetype, which will contain specific details of the living will as per national or other local requirements. In countries where a living will has legal status, it MUST be ensured that the EVALUATION.living_will archetype and nested living will details CLUSTER archetype adhere to the specific legal requirements.">
