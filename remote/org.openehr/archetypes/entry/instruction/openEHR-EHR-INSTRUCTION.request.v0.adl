			use = <"Use to record a request for a single health-related service or a well-defined package of services that have identical attributes. If multiple or a group of services are ordered at the same time but with different attributes, each services should be represented using a separate instance of this archetype.

This archetype has been designed as a framework that can be used as the basis for:
- a request from one clinician, organisation or agency to another clinician, organisation or agency for a health-related service. For example: a referral to a specialist clinician for treatment or a second clinical opinion; transfer of care to an emergency department; four hourly vital signs monitoring; and provision of home services from a municipal council; or
- a request for a follow up service to be scheduled for the same clinician, organisation or agency. For example: a review appointment in outpatients in 6 weeks. 

Clinical use cases:
- consider a clinician ordering a followup appointment in 6 weeks. 'Followup appointment' will be the 'Service name'. If they enter '6 weeks' as the proposed timing for the appointment in the User Interface, the clinical system will record the date six weeks from today in the 'Service due' data element.
- consider a clinician ordering Diabetes Education as the 'Service name'. The values for 'Reason for request' may be  'New diagnosis' and 'Prevention of Ketoacidosis'. The 'Clinical indication' will be 'Diabetes Type 1', which may be linked to the Problem Diagnosis and/or Laboratory test results. If a 4 week course is required then the more complex timing will be recorded using the CLUSTER.timing_nondaily archetype - weekly intervals for 4 services.
- consider a clinician ordering a recurring blood test, such as an INR. The complex timing for this requires use of the CLUSTER.service_direction and associated CLUSTER.timing_nondaily archetype to define each timing in a sequence of tests, such as 'daily for one week, weekly for 4 weeks, monthly for 6 months'.

In many situations it will be possible to record the steps that occur as part of this request being carried out using the corresponding generic ACTION.service. However, there will be many occasions where the required ACTION archetype will be very specific for purpose, as the data requirements for recording provision of many health-related services will need quite unique data elements, recording patterns or pathway steps. For example: ACTION.screening or ACTION.health_education.">
